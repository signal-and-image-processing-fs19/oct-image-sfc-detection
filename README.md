# OCT image SRF detection
Final group project of the signal and image processing course.

## Task ##
The goal is to find a image processing solution to detect from OCT images, if it shows SRF (subretinal fluid) which is a diagnostic factor in detecting degenerative retinal diseases.
sub-retinal fluid (SRF) corresponds to the accumulation of a clear or lipid-rich exudate in the
sub-retinal space, i.e., between the photoreceptor layer and the underlying retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE).

What to look for: homogeneous hypo reflective well-defined areas between the retinal
pigment epithelium layer (RPE) and photoreceptor layer.

Textbook example of sub-retinal fluid:
